# mma8451_pi

Library to use the MMA8451 accelerometer sensor via IÂ²C on a Raspberry Pi in C.

Not (yet) functional. I'm currently writing the thing.

Makefile and insiration borrowed from https://github.com/leachj/vl6180_pi

Somewhat based on the Arduino library here https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MMA8451_Library
